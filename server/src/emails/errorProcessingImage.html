        <p>Unfortunately, there was an error detecting the type of content in your prompt. This doesn't mean you did anything wrong, just that the automated systems couldn't figure out what to do with it. Hopefully they will improve with time. Right now though, in the interest of safety for the community, the Share has been deleted. Please continue posting, as this doesn't happen often.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
