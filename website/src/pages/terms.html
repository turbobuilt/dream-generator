Terms and Conditions

These terms and conditions are important since this is a social app.

1. No hacking, no abuse of the system.  Use as it was intended, and don't break it.

2. No immoral or illegal content.  Do not use the system to make content that would upset you if you thought about having made it at a later time.  It offers wide latitude in what you can make.  We don't believe in controlling people, so be responsible.

3.  Don't share stuff that will hurt people.  Use wisdom in what you post and don't get into trouble.  If you post things that are innapropriate it will be addressed because Apple says we have to.  We think it's a good idea though, and just had to implement it sooner than we thought, but please be smart and don't get in trouble. If you post offensive content, it's ok.  But if it goes too far your account may be restricted from posting. This is really annoying but certain app stores require it. We do our best to avoid bans, but be responsible, as we can't fix everything for you.

4.  We update these terms regularly. 

5. If you share content, we will keep that content online for indefinite periods of time potentially.  We aren't trying to hurt anyone, but we feel this could be good since it's all user generated.  You can anonymize stuff though by deleting your account.

6. We may use shared content in marketing materials.

7. If you share to facebook or via text, we will share the content on the app for now. We intend to change this in the future, but just want to give you a heads up right now.
